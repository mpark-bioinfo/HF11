## Data Cleaning
0. The normalized data from the Core are used to calculate CV. (manually done in excel)
* CV = STDEV/AVERAGE * 100)
* Column names: Name/CV/DataforSamples
* Check if all sample column order and names are same! 
* Output filename: "_Pos.txt", "_Neg.txt"

1. Separate Name column to Lipid/Adduct/RT ("1_separated_lipid_name.pl")
* Input filename: "_Pos.txt", "_Neg.txt"
* Column names: Lipid/Adduct/RT/CV/DataforSamples
* Output filename: "_LipidSeparated.txt"

2. Remove redundant species - select the lesser CV ("2_RemoveDuplicateLipids.R")
* Output filename: "_nonRedundant.txt"

3. Separated Lipid column to Class/Carbon/Saturation ("3_extract_lipid_class.pl")
* Input filename: "_nonRedundant.txt"
* Column names: "Class/Carbon/Saturation/CV/DataforSamples
* Output filename: "_LipidClass.txt"

4. Remove odd chain species ("4_RemoveOddChain.R")
* Input filename: "_LipidClass.txt"
* Check even number in saturation column for animals
* Output filename: "*_noOdd.txt"

5. Remove unrelated class in each polar group and combine them ("5_ExtractRelavantClass.R")
* Refer to the positive/negative list of lipid class
* Input filename: "*_noOdd.txt"
* Output filename: "*_final.txt"

7. Final processed lipid data
```{r echo = FALSE}
    #dim(temp_lipidset)
```

Complete!
```{r setup, include=FALSE}
    summary(SCN_pos)

```

## Data Cleaning

This is an R Markdown document. Markdown is a simple formatting syntax for authoring HTML, PDF, and MS Word documents. For more details on using R Markdown see <http://rmarkdown.rstudio.com>.

When you click the **Knit** button a document will be generated that includes both content as well as the output of any embedded R code chunks within the document. You can embed an R code chunk like this:

```{r cars}
summary(cars)
```

## Including Plots

You can also embed plots, for example:

```{r pressure, echo=FALSE}
plot(pressure)
```

Note that the `echo = FALSE` parameter was added to the code chunk to prevent printing of the R code that generated the plot.
